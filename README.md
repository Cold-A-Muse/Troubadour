# Troubadour
A data enhancement platform providing intuitive and accessible natural language processing (NLP). 

# Introduction
In order to boost the development of applications on the blockchain, iExec reserved a prize pool of $150,000 to be distributed among different dapp projects. The iExec Jury ran its due diligence processes on these projects, and has retained 15 winners of development grants including our project Troubadour which is a data enhancement platform providing intuitive and accessible natural language processing (NLP) solutions, as a solution to the information overload problem that unstructured data causes.
